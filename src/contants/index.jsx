My journey into web development began with a deep curiosity about how things work, which has since evolved into a career focused on continuous learning and adaptation.

I completed a six-month MEARN full-stack development course in July 2024, followed by self-training through online resources to refine my web development skills. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience as a Salesforce developer for six months, further expanding my technical expertise.
